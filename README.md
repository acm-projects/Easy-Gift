Objective
=
> Create an app that makes gifitng easy. Keep that in mind for the whole project. Users 
> are able to create profiles with wishlists, one click shopping, form groups with other
> users, and have gift recomendations. The idea is that anyone using the app can either quickly 
> glance at a users profile and buy a gift on their "wishlist" or get a good idea of want they
> through recomendations.


MVP
==
- Users can create personal profiles with a wishlist of items they want
- Wishlists can be sorted by price, or by a "priority" of how much the user wants it
- Users can form groups and see each others profiles, and when a user buys a gift for another user,
the group knows that gift has been purchased except the person who the gift was bought for.
- Allow for "one click" shopping for EASY gifting. i.e. links for each gift so users wont have
to search for a gift, and can instead just click and purchase
